# Tic Tac Toe Lab

![tic-tac-toe meme](assets/ttt_meme.jpg)

**Objective:** Build a tic tac toe game in HTML and JavaScript using jQuery.

## Required Game components
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
* When a square is clicked, there should be visual feedback.
* Every click will alternate between being for Player 1 or Player 2. The visual feedback should indicate whose turn it is.
* A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
* After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the
  winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row.
    * Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those
      combinations on the board contents after every move.

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo into your account.
1. Once the forking is complete, **clone** the repo onto your computer.
1. From the command-line: 
    - `npm i` (this will get all the tools necessary for this exercise)
1. You have been given blank index.html, script.js, and style.css files. Please use those files to complete your work.

## Bonus
* Use an HTML form to allow players to enter their names
* Style it! give it a personal flavor.
* Check out the website [bitbaloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) and host your game there.

## Ultra Bonus
* We once had a student implement an Artifical Intelligence (AI)
  opponent. If you really need a challenge, write some code that will
  play a game of Tic Tac Toe against you. (Hint: look into the minimax
  algorithm).


## Deliverable

* Everyone's game will look different but you can check out the following screenshots to get some basic design ideas.
